# Vasari Purists

- **Some people are very interested in having the Vasari depend as little as possible on using planets, including me, so this mod adds a faction that does NOT depend on them at all!**

## Main features

- *This mod changes nothing functional about other factions.*
- *Do not use this in combination with other mods as they might not work properly with the new faction.*
- *Also, balance is very much TBD.*

- You start out with a Titan instead of the Jarrasul, which is weaker than a standard Kultorask titan at this point.
- This titan is your 'capital'; if you lose it, you lose the game.
    - It is also the only factory that can create capital ships.

### You have multiple ways to actively and passively gather resources:

- **Active**
    - The Jaratok Evader (former Jarrasul Evacuator) has an ability to gather metal and crystal from planets resource asteroids.
    - This resource extraction is also possible using a component, buildable on the other capital ships and the Jarak Extractor (former Jarun Migrator).
    - An upgraded form of pillaging other planets that the TEC Rebels have can be researched.
    - The Jusotra Fabricator Cruiser can still be used to gather resources from destroyed ships, including a second upgrade technology.
    - Derelicts can still be gathered.
- **Passive**
- Three components can be built on capital ships and the Titan:
    - Metal Scrapers
    - Crystal Scrapers
    - Artificial Economy

- Civilian research also provides crystal income, and the first tier includes the +3 resource bonus that would otherwise be obtained from your capital planet.

- Culture, shipyards and research labs are all done via ships.

- **Removal of all irrelevant content**
    - This includes technologies, items and anything related to planets.

- **18 New technologies, many reworked**

- **9 New ship items, many reworked**

- **2 New ships, couple reworked**

- **Reworked Titan**
	- It is a phase synchronizer, collecting phase resonance if it is present in a gravity well
    - It has two new abilities (shield generator and turret deployement)
    - It can increase up to level 12
    - It is somewhat weaker starting out than the 'normal' Varari Rebel titan, but should balance out depending on item choices

- Many miscellaneous tweaks are included, like more starting resources, moving certain technologies to be researched sooner and a 200% build speed penalty on components when not near an item shop (instead of 400%) .

## Known issues:

- Resource extraction is based on both planets and asteroids, instead of just asteroids. This is because an ability cannot auto cast on resource asteroids currently. I will likely remove the planet extraction down the line.
- The AI naturally doesn't seem be able to handle the new faction at all, so I would not use random opponents (currently unable to change AI faction selection via modding) -if there is one in the game, they might give errors which you should SKIP/SKIP ALL if they occur.
