# Vasari Purists

- **Some people are very interested in having the Vasari depend as little as possible on using planets, including me, so this mod adds a faction that does NOT depend on them!**

## Main features

- *This mod changes nothing about other factions.*
- *Do not use this in combination with other mods as they might not work properly.*
- *Also, balance is very much TBD.*
- You start out with just a Titan, which is weaker than a standard Kultorask titan at this point.
- This titan is your 'capital'; if you lose it, you lose the game.
    - It is also the only factory that can create capital ships.

- You have multiple ways to actively and passively gather resources:
- **Active**
    - The Jaratok Evader (former Jarrasul Evacuator) has an ability to gather metal and crystal from resource asteroids.
    - This resource extraction is also possible using a component, buildable on capital ships, the Titan and the Jarak Extractor (former Jarun Migrator).
    - An upgraded form of pillaging other planets that the TEC Rebels have can be researched.
    - The Jusotra Fabricator Cruiser can still be used to gather resources from destroyed ships, including a second upgrade technology.
    - Derelicts can still be gathered.
- **Passive**
- Three components can be built on capital ships and the Titan:
    - Metal Scrapers
    - Crystal Scrapers
    - Artificial Economy

- Civilian research also provides crystal income, and the first tier includes the +3 resource bonus that would otherwise be obtained from the capital.

- Culture, shipyards and research labs are all done via ships.

- **Removal of all irrelevant content**
    - This includes technologies, items and anything related to planets.

- **13 New ship**
- To boost the economy on the move

- **13 New technologies**

- **9 New ship items**

- **Reworked Titan**
    - It has a new, fitting, ultimate ability with a 'new' unit
    - It can go up to level 12
    - It is somewhat weaker starting out, but should balance out depending on item choices
<br>
- Many miscellaneous tweaks are included, like more starting resources, moving certain technologies to be researched sooner and a 200% build speed penalty on components when not near an item shop (instead of 400%) .

## Known issues
- Resource extraction gives both metal and crystal regardless of the type of resource asteroid.
- Resource extraction does not autocast (leading to a lot of micromanagement, I increased the duration of the ability/item because of this for now).
- An error occurs when deploying the Titan's turrets; just skip it, I can't seem to fix it but it doesn't seem to impact anything.
- The AI naturally doesn't seem be able to handle the new faction at all, so I would not use random opponents (currently unable to change AI faction selection via modding) -if there is one in the game, they might give errors which you should SKIP.

*Let me know if you have feedback!*
